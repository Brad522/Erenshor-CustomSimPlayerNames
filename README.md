# Erenshor-CustomSimPlayerNames
This mod allows you to customize the names of the SimPlayers in Erenshor.

## Requirements
BepInEx 5 is required for this mod to work.

## Installation

1. [Install BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
2. Download the latest '.zip' file from [Releases](https://github.com/Brad522/Erenshor-CustomSimPlayerNames/releases)
3. Extract all files into your Erenshor folder.

## Usage

There are two ".txt" files located in the mod folder
- "NameDatabaseMale.txt"
- "NameDatabaseFemale.txt"

Edit these files with the names you want to use for the SimPlayers. Each line should contain one name.
The game will only use around 50 names from each file going from top to bottom.

To see the names in game you need to reset the SimPlayer data using the reset button on the login screen of the game.
